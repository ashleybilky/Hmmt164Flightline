	<p>The knightrider flightline performs various maintenance functions 
	that are vital to meet the operational demands set forth by the commanding officer. 
	Periodic maintenance and special, conditional, and phase inspections are just a few 
	of the tasks that are performed by the mechanics and crewchiefs. The flightline 
	division is also unique from other work centers in the squadron because over half of 
	the personnel also participate in flight operations of the squadron.</p>
	
	<p>The crewchiefs and aerial observers play a vital role in the 
	squadron by performing the daily and turnaround inspections that are required to 
	ensure that the helicopters are mechanically and structurally safe to fly. They also 
	provide in-flight troubleshooting,cargo loading, and passenger embarkation and debarkation. </p>

<aside>	
	<p>The mechanic crewchief team concept provides as many full mission 
	capable aircraft for the commanding officers operational commitments. The personnel 
	in the work center have various qualifications for support equipment that provide
	preventative maintenance on the aircraft to keep a 50 year old helicopter flying 
	through the 21st century.
